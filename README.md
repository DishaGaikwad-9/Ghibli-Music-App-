The application features a dynamic Day and Night mode, where the Day mode showcases gently floating cloud animations, and the Night mode is enhanced with softly glowing, floating fireflies. These subtle animations add a soothing sense of calm and immersion to the user experience. The modes can be seamlessly switched using an intuitive sun/moon toggle located at the top-right corner of the interface.
